      "- **Strengths**: None\n",
      "- **Areas for Improvement**:\n",
      "  1. **Relevance**: The candidate's response does not address the question about code reviews and their role in improving code quality and sharing knowledge within a team. The response seems to be a personal introduction rather than an answer to the question.\n",
      "  2. **Clarity & Structure**: The answer lacks any structure or clarity. It does not provide any meaningful information related to the question.\n",
      "  3. **Confidence & Communication**: The response does not reflect confidence or professionalism. It appears to be a casual and unprepared introduction.\n",
      "  4. **Depth & Examples**: There are no explanations or examples provided to support any points related to code reviews.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommendation for Improvement**:\n",
      "To improve, the candidate should:\n",
      "- Ensure their response directly addresses the question asked.\n",
      "- Organize their thoughts into a clear and structured answer.\n",
      "- Demonstrate confidence and professionalism in their communication.\n",
      "- Provide detailed explanations and examples to support their points, especially when discussing technical topics like code reviews. \n",
      "\n",
      "For this question, a more appropriate response might include:\n",
      "- An introduction to their experience with code reviews.\n",
      "- An explanation of how code reviews can improve code quality (e.g., by catching bugs, improving readability, and adhering to standards).\n",
      "- Discussion on how code reviews facilitate knowledge sharing within a team (e.g., through feedback, learning from others' approaches, and standardizing practices).\n",
      "- Examples from their own experience, highlighting successes or challenges and what they learned from them.\n",
      "- Confidence Score: 40\n",
      "- Feedback: The response 'i am uvarajan' lacks clarity and assertiveness, as it is written in lowercase and does not provide any additional information about the user. The absence of filler words is a positive aspect, but the overall tone strength is weak due to the informal writing style. To improve, the user could capitalize the first letter of their name and the first person pronoun 'I', and consider adding more context or details about themselves to sound more confident and clear. For example, \"I am Uvarajan, nice to meet you.\" This would help project a stronger tone and more assertive introduction.\n",
      "Can you give an example of a time when you had to make a difficult technical decision, and how you approached this\n"
